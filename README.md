## App Description
You will create a movie rating app. The app should allow users to display movies that meet certain search criteria. Users should also be able to give movies "star ratings". In addition to creating the frontend application, you will need to develop a simple API. The focus of the challenge is on functionality (i.e. does the page display the correct information). Seed data for movies is included in this repo.

## Requirements

- The app should display a list or table of movies that meet search parameters.
  - The list or table should display: movie title, director, release year, and MPAA rating (e.g. G, PG, etc.)
  - The search parameters should be: movie genre, release year range, and MPAA rating
- The list should be sortable by all displayed parameters, including MPAA rating
- For each movie in the list, the user should be able to review that movie on a scale of 1 to 5 stars (a "star rating") and leave a comment anonymously
  - The comment should be limited to 500 characters or less
- There should be a view where users can see the average star rating and comments for each movie
- Submitted star ratings and comments should persist on refresh

## Technologies
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Express.js
- Data storage: you can choose

## Submission
Please submit your project as a publicly accessible git repository. Include clear instructions on how to run your solution on our computers. List any assumptions that you made. In your response, please let us know approximately how long the challenge took to complete. Bonus points if you are able to publicly host your solution someplace (e.g. Heroku, AWS), but this is not required.

## Evaluation
We will evaluate your solution based on the following criteria
- Is the code well documented/commented?
- Is the code understandable and maintainable?
- Did the project meet the requirements outlined above?
- Are there tests?

## Bonus
For bonus points, add any other features that you think might be useful or tell us what features you would add if you had more time.
